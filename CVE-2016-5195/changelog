0.1.0  First release
0.2.0  Debugging:  now is guaranteed that the credentials of root, the current user and sshd user,
       are placed the first lines of /etc/passwd. Corrected parameter size error in madvise. Tested on Ununt 14.04 LTS.
0.2.2  Minor changing: delete heap allocated vars, O2 optimizer. Tested on Mint 17.2.
0.2.4  Removed redundant fstat, removed depracated getlogin() and replaced with getpwuid() and getuid(),
       reduced the timeout to a more realistic value, added the notification "Running..." when the exploit
       start. Debugging, wrong condition on timeout check.
0.2.6  Removed unnecessary code.
0.2.8  Removed unnecessary code.
0.3.2  Major improvements: in case of successful exploiting, the kernel flusher threads will be disabled 
       to avoid kernel cashes on some distros. Now it's possible to open automatically a root shell specifying 
       the -s parameter:
       ./dcow -s
       Minor: a -h parameter with the synopsis is present. 
0.3.4  Now if specified -s, the password file will be immediately restored when the root shell appears.
       A -n parameter is added to prevent this behaviour. If -n is specified with -s, a backup of the
       password file will be created int the home othe the unprivileged user.
0.3.6  Forced the unalias of cp and rm commands. Debugging -n/no param passwd backup  behaviour 
       for retrocompatibility.
0.3.8  Added a version of the program that can be compiled using compilers without c++11 support.
       Minor cleaning of the original c++11 version. 
0.3.10 Added golang version of this exploit
