Please, before opening an issue, do these steps:

-   check the source code repository, to be sure that you are using the last version available
-   check the documentation of the documentation or the kernel changelogs to be sure that the exploit is valid for that version;

After that, being sure that the problem happen using the last version in a vulnerable enviroment, the issue must contains the following information:

-   Version of the exploit (see changelog file), so I can be sure that the problem wasn't solved in the meantime;
-   A brief description (in English) of the problem (core dump, freeze, etc);
-   Description of the environment ( OS type and version, kernel version );
-   Specific information related to the issue, needed to reproduce/debug the issue itself: backtrace from the core dump; compiler errors, system log messages, etc.

Any issue notification opened without that information will be silently closed.

Thanks.
